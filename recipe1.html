        1 te aspoon chili powder <br />
        1 teaspoon coriander <br />
        1 cup water <br />
        3 tablespoons butter <br />
        1 cinnamon stick <br />
        2 bay leaves <br />
        1 teaspoon cumin seeds <br />
        1 teaspoon garlic paste, (grate garlic with a Microplane) <br />
        1 teaspoon ginger paste (grate ginger with a Microplane) <br />
        ½ teaspoon chili powder <br />

        ⅓ cup heavy cream <br />
        Red food coloring (Optional) <br />
        1 recipe Paneer Cheese <br />
        <h2>instruction</h2>

        Heat the oil in a large pot. Add the cardamom pods and cashews, fry for
        1-2 minutes until cardamom becomes aromatic, and cashews become slightly
        golden brown. Add in the onions and cook for 3-4 minutes, until
        translucent. Add in the tomatoes, salt, sugar, garam masala, cumin
        powder, chili powder, and coriander then cook for an additional 5
        minutes. <br />
        Transfer the contents of the pot into a blender along with 1 cup of
        water. Blend for at least 2-3 minutes until silky smooth. Once blended,
        set aside. <br />
        In the same pot, melt the butter then add in the cinnamon stick, bay
        leaves, and cumin seeds. Fry for about 45 seconds until fragrant. Add in
        the ginger paste, garlic paste, chili powder, and turmeric, then cook
        for another minute until slightly brown on the edges. Pour the blended
        mixture back into the pot, followed by the heavy cream. If a deeper
        orange color is desired (optional), add in a few drops of red food
        coloring. Cook on a low heat for 10 minutes to allow the flavors to
        combine. <br />
        Meanwhile, heat oil in a large frying pan and fry the paneer cheese
        cubes until golden brown on all the sides. Once fried, add the paneer to
        the gravy and stir to combine. <br />
        Serve hot along with rice and/or Indian bread like Garlic Naan or Roti.
